      <p>I am new to central Florida and am loving the low altitude! I am excited to explore the area and see what there is to do.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am originally from south Florida but moved to Colorado a few years ago. Now I'm back in my home state and am being reminded of why I left...</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to play League of Legends although I am not very good. I also enjoy trying new things with awesome people.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't have a dream job but working with Riot Games would be legendary.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Maitland, FL.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As a highschooler I would go into the source code of the website that displayed my grades and change them to my liking. From there I started going to other websites and seeing what I could alter. My interest has been piqued ever since then and I'd love to make web development a career!</p>
